# weather-dashboard-cw

## Description

This was a cool project to help me get used to using javascript as well as dealing with apis. In this project I had to sign up for a weather api key and then use the fetch comamnd to get teh data from the api. Now 

## Usage

To start type in a location. Then press search for it to give you the weather in that location for the week. You can looka t your history to go back and see what locations youve researched recently.
